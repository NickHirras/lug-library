If you do not know how to use a MySQL database from PHP then just look
through a few of the existing scripts on this site.  They use a standard
and common method of using the database throughought all the scripts.  
Study them for syntax and functions.

The subdirectory called sql under the main library sight contains scripts
to create the inital database tables.  View / print those files to have
a handy reference to what the database layout is.

If you have just installed the library app you will need to setup
a database for it.  Directions are in the /sql subdirectory.  Make sure
to edit include.php to have the correct login information.
