<strong>My Book Has No ISBN</strong>

<blockquote>
         If the product you are entering does not have
         an ISBN number, feel free to make one up,
         but make sure it's something unique so that it
         doesn't conflict with other products.  For instance,
         a book called Linux Kernel Hacks published in
         2001, you might use "LNXKRNLHCKS2001A".  Your
         fake ISBN can contain only numbers and letters, no
         special characters, dashes, or spaces.  And should
         be no more than 35 characters.
