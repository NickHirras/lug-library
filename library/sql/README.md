Library Database Installation
=============================

First make sure that the account you're installing under has the 
appropriate permissions to create database tables.

Create a database under this user named 'pluglib'.  Then run each
file in this directory.  To run these files execute:

mysql --password='yourpasswordhere' < filename.sql

Also be sure to update ../include.php so that the scripts will have
the correct login info they need to access the database.
